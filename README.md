# worldcup2014_Brazil

AngularJs app for world cup 2014 The task We liked the last world cup very much and so we would like to have a closer look at the results. The task is designed to assess your interest and experience in front-end web development. We want to see your code, your approach, and your talent.

Minimum requirements Use AngularJS and an API.

For each of the eight groups there should be:

a table showing the final result a pie chart dividing the points of each team We leave the design and user experience completely up to you. Of course we are happy to see more statistics - so if you have ideas feel free to suprise us.

What we are looking for Does the app meet the minimum requirements? Is your code clean and well written? What was your approach? How does your app look and feel? Getting started Just go ahead and create your HTML, CSS and JS files. You are free to use any public library out there.

For the API there is http://worldcup.sfg.io for example.
